# overengineered
This is a fun repo. How to solve a problem with over-engeered solutions / overusing tools.

## What is happening here?

Currently I have 2 solutions to the very hard problem of print "Hello World!".
One of them is using Spring, because every serious solution must have dependency 
injection. The otherone (which was mad later) overuses Java lambdas (and looks
like clojure), and was made to share all features with the spring solution.

## Do you have a fun example?
